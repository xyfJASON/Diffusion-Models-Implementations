The DDPM UNet architecture proposed in [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).

The original codes are in TensorFlow, so we use the PyTorch version developed by [pesser](https://github.com/pesser).

Codes are copied and adapted from https://github.com/pesser/pytorch_diffusion.
