# Classifier-Free Guidance

## Training

```python
accelerate-launch train_classifier_free.py [-c CONFIG] [-e EXP_DIR] [--xxx.yyy zzz ...]
```

- This repo uses the [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) library for multi-GPUs/fp16 supports. Please read the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/basic_tutorials/launch#using-accelerate-launch) on how to launch the scripts on different platforms.
- Results (logs, checkpoints, tensorboard, etc.) of each run will be saved to `EXP_DIR`. If `EXP_DIR` is not specified, they will be saved to `runs/exp-{current time}/`.

- To modify some configuration items without creating a new configuration file, you can pass `--key value` pairs to the script. For example, the default probability to disable guidance in training (`p_uncond`) in `./configs/classifier_free_cifar10.yaml` is 0.2, and if you want to change it to 0.1, you can simply pass `--train.p_uncond 0.1`.

For example, to train on CIFAR-10 with default settings:

```shell
accelerate-launch train_classifier_free.py -c ./configs/classifier_free_cifar10.yaml
```



## Sampling

```shell
accelerate-launch sample_classifier_free.py -c CONFIG \
                                            [--seed SEED] \
                                            --weights WEIGHTS \
                                            [--load_ema LOAD_EMA] \
                                            [--skip_steps SKIP_STEPS] \
                                            --n_samples_each_class N_SAMPLES_EACH_CLASS \
                                            --guidance_scale GUIDANCE_SCALE \
                                            [--ddim] \
                                            [--ddim_eta DDIM_ETA] \
                                            --save_dir SAVE_DIR [--micro_batch MICRO_BATCH]
```

- This repo uses the [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index) library for multi-GPUs/fp16 supports. Please read the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/basic_tutorials/launch#using-accelerate-launch) on how to launch the scripts on different platforms.
- Use `--skip_steps SKIP_STEPS` for faster sampling that skip timesteps. 
- Use `--ddim` for DDIM sampling.
- Specify `--micro_batch MICRO_BATCH` to sample images batch by batch. Set it as large as possible to fully utilize your devices.
- I use $s$ in [Classifier Guidance paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233) as the scale factor (`--guidance_scale`) rather than $w$ in the [Classifier-Free Guidance paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598). In fact, we have $s=w+1$, and:
  - $s=0$: unconditional generation
  - $s=1$: non-guided conditional generation
  - $s>1$: guided conditional generation




## Evaluation

Same as DDPM. Please refer to [DDPM doc](./DDPM.md).

- The images are sampled using DDIM with 50 steps.
- All the metrics are evaluated on 50K samples.
- FID measures diversity and IS measures fidelity. This table shows diversity-fidelity trade-off as guidance scale increases.



**Samples with different guidance scale**:

From left to right: $s=0$ (unconditional), $s=1.0$ (non-guided conditional), $s=3.0$, $s=5.0$. Each row corresponds to a class.
